This attribute allows you to write PL/SQL code to update the event row in the database after the user drags and drops an event on the calendar.

It adds a new navigation bar entry named Install App to your app, which allows users to install the app on their device?s home screen and access it offline. It enhances the app?s appearance and behavior by using a manifest file to specify the app?s name, icon, theme color, orientation, and display mode. The other options are incorrect because: To use the PWA feature, the Friendly URLS attribute in the Application Definition, Properties section must be turned On. This attribute enables user-friendly URLs that are required for PWA functionality. PWA features will not be rendered if the application is served in an unsecured environment.

This tool allows you to drag and drop a region type (such as Classic Report, Interactive Report, or Interactive Grid) onto the page and define its attributes and source. The other option is incorrect because: You cannot create a report from Object Browser. Object Browser is a tool that allows you to view and manage the database objects in your schema, such as tables, views, indexes, etc. You can only run SQL queries or scripts from this tool, not create reports.

        "explanations": "Explanation: A Faceted Search and a Smart Filter are two types of pages that behave similarly in functionality. They both allow users to filter data based on multiple criteria and see the results in real time. They differ in the following aspects: A Faceted Search uses facets to filter data. A facet is a set of filters based on a column or expression. A facet can be displayed as a list, a range slider, a star rating, or a chart. A Smart Filter uses conditions to filter data. A condition is a logical expression that evaluates to true or false. A condition can be based on a column, an item, or a function. The other options are incorrect because: A Map is a type of region that displays spatial data on an interactive map. It allows users to zoom, pan, and select features on the map.

A checkbox can have either static values or dynamic values based on a list of values (LOV). A checkbox can also have different display styles, such as pill button or switch. Date Picker: A date picker is a page item that displays a text field with an icon that opens a calendar popup when clicked. A date picker allows users to enter or select a date value in a specific format. A date picker can also have different attributes, such as minimum or maximum date, display format, or time picker.

        "explanations": "Explanation: When you run an application, the APEX engine relies on two processes: Show Page and Accept Page. Show Page is responsible for rendering the page and sending it to the browser. Accept Page is responsible for processing the page when it is submitted by the browser. Run Page is not a process, but a command that can be used to run an application or a page from SQL Workshop or Application Builder. Validate Page is not a process, but a step that occurs during page processing to check for any validations defined on the page",

        "explanations": "Explanation: When you click a Customer Name in the Customers report, the Customer Details form dialog page is displayed. This involves two events: page rendering and page processing. Page rendering is the event that occurs when APEX generates and sends the page to the browser. Page processing is the event that occurs when APEX receives and processes the page from the browser. In this scenario, both events happen because the Customer Details form dialog page is a modal dialog that uses AJAX to communicate with the server without reloading the entire page. Page compilation is not an event, but an action that occurs when APEX compiles an application or a page before running it.",

There are many types of forms that can be created in APEX, such as forms on tables, forms on procedures, forms on web sources, and so on. Each type of form has different properties and attributes that affect its appearance and functionality. Three of the ways in which you can create a form in APEX are: Using the Create Page wizard: This method allows you to create a new page with a form component using a guided wizard. You can choose from different types of forms, such as report with form, editable interactive grid, single page master detail, two page master detail, form on table, form on procedure, and so on. You can also specify various options for your form, such as data source, display style, validations, processes, and branches. Create a Form region in Page Designer: This method allows you to create a complex form region that includes multiple form items and processes on an existing page. You can use the Create Form Region wizard in Page Designer to create a form region based on a table, view, procedure, web source module, or SQL query. You can also customize your form region by adding or modifying items, buttons, validations, computations, processes, and dynamic actions. Using the Create Application Wizard: This method allows you to create a new application that contains one or more forms using a guided wizard. You can choose from different types of applications, such as database application, web source application, blueprint application, or from scratch application. You can also specify various options for your application and forms, such as name, icon, theme style, features, data source, navigation menu entry, and so on.",

        "explanations": "Explanation: A facet is a type of component that provides a set of display values and return values for a faceted search region or a smart filters region. A facet can be based on either static values or dynamic values from a list of values (LOV). A facet can also have different display styles depending on its type and settings. Three of the types of facets that you can create in APEX are: Range: A range facet displays numeric values in either buckets or sliders that users can select or adjust to filter the search results. A range facet can have either static values or dynamic values based on an LOV or SQL query. Checkbox Group: A checkbox group facet displays multiple options that users can select or deselect to filter the search results. A checkbox group facet can have either static values or dynamic values based on an LOV or SQL query. Input Field: An input field facet displays a text field that users can enter text to filter the search results. An input field facet does not have any values but uses an operator to compare the user input with the data.",

        "explanations": "Explanation: A faceted search is a type of component that enables users to filter information easily and intuitively by selecting the options in each facet. A faceted search consists of a faceted search region and a search results region. The faceted search region displays on the left and upper part of the screen and shows possible values and occurrence counts for each facet. The search results region displays on the right side of the screen and shows the data that matches the selected facet values. The search results region can display as either a classic report or a cards report. Three of the statements that are true about faceted search are: After the end user changes a facet, the results, dependent facets, and occurrence counts refresh immediately. This feature provides instant feedback to the user and allows them to refine their search criteria without reloading the page. The right side of the page features a Search Results region, which can display as a classic report or a cards report. A classic report displays data in a tabular format with columns and rows. A cards report displays data in a grid of cards with images and text. The facets are displayed on the left and upper part of the screen. This layout provides a clear separation between the facets and the results and allows users to see and access all the facets without scrolling.",

        "explanations": "Explanation: The Approvals Component is Oracle APEX?s new offering as part of the 22.1 Release. It allows seamless management of approvals across APEX Applications. Approvals are commonly used in business situations involving Expense Reimbursements, Leave Requests, Purchase Requisitions, On-boarding of Employees to name a few. The Approvals Component provides the following building blocks for the approvals functionality: Task Definition: A shared component for configuring task parameters, participants, and actions. A task definition defines the template for creating tasks based on a specific type of approval request, such as Leave Approval or Purchase Requisition. A task definition specifies the data source, display attributes, potential owners, business administrators, and available actions for the tasks. Task Details Page: A page that shows task details, which can include metadata, history, comments, and actions. A task details page allows users to view and take action on a specific task, such as approve, reject, reassign, or escalate. A task details page can be created using the Create Page Wizard or the Quick SQL tool in APEX. Unified Task List: A page type in the Create Page Wizard, used to create a summary of a user?s tasks that functions like an inbox. A unified task list allows users to see and manage all their tasks in one place. Users can filter, sort, search, claim, release, or open tasks from the unified task list.",

        "explanations": "Explanation: Automations are a sequential set of PL/SQL actions that are triggered by query results. They are used to monitor data and then perform the appropriate action2. Some use cases of automations are: Monitoring log tables and raising an alert when there is an issue. For example, an automation can query a log table for any errors and send an email notification to the administrator if any errors are found2. Approving specific requests. For example, an automation can query a table for any pending requests and approve them automatically based on some criteria2. Sending email alerts at a particular time of the week. For example, an automation can query a table for any overdue tasks and send a reminder email to the assignees every Monday2. Deleting a database record based on an end user?s request is not a use case of automations, as it does not involve querying data and triggering actions based on the query results.

        "explanations": "Explanation: Data Synchronization enables developers to automatically sync the contents of a local table with the data from a REST service. APEX invokes the REST service defined in the REST Data Source, downloads all data and synchronizes it to a local table6. Data Synchronization has several benefits, such as: APEX can create the local table based on the visible columns in the REST Data Source Data Profile. Since the table is physically available in the database schema, developers can add indexes, change physical properties, or even add more columns6. Data Synchronization helps in providing efficient reporting on large data sets coming from a REST service. Some REST services can return large amounts of result data that include pagination. If a reporting requirement needs larger data sets, this would lead to multiple HTTP requests and poorer response times. Also, no indexes or other database features can be used to speed up reporting queries. In this case, synchronizing the remote data to a local table and having the reports working on local tables can improve performance and user experience6. Data Synchronization can also collect data from REST services for consumption by PL/SQL packages or other logic. If data from the REST service is replicated to local tables, developers will be able to perform all sorts of processing and also generate different types of reports6. You do not have to trigger Data Synchronization manually, as you can also schedule it to run periodically using a DBMS_SCHEDULER expression6.",

You can select a preconfigured authentication scheme from the gallery when you create an authentication scheme for your application. The preconfigured authentication schemes are: Open Door Credentials: This scheme enables anyone to access your application using a built-in login page that captures a user name. LDAP Directory: This scheme authenticates a user and password with an authentication request to a LDAP server. HTTP Header Variable: This scheme authenticates users externally by storing the username in a HTTP Header variable set by the web server. Social Sign-In: This scheme supports authentication with Google, Facebook, and other social networks that support OpenID Connector OAuth2 standards. Oracle APEX Accounts: This scheme authenticates users against Oracle APEX user accounts that are created within and managed in the APEX user repository. Custom Authentication: This scheme allows you to create a custom authentication scheme from scratch to have complete control over your authentication interface. Database Accounts: This scheme authenticates users using database schema accounts. Oracle Application Server Single Sign-On Server: This scheme delegates authentication to the Oracle AS Single Sign-On (SSO) Server. SAML Sign-In: This scheme delegates authentication to the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) Sign In authentication scheme.",

Three of the authentication methods that you can choose in Oracle APEX are: Custom Authentication Scheme: This method allows you to create your own authentication logic using PL/SQL code or an external web service. You can also customize the login page and session management for your application. No Authentication (using DAD): This method adopts the current database user as the authenticated user. This approach can be used in combination with a mod_plsql Database Access Descriptor (DAD) configuration that uses basic authentication to set the database session user.

A chart can display data in various formats, such as bars, lines, areas, ranges, combinations, scatters, bubbles, polars, radars, pies, donuts, funnels, and more. Oracle APEX supports charts based on the Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (Oracle JET) Data Visualizations. Oracle JET is a modular open source toolkit based on modern JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5 design and development principles. Three of the correct statements about charts in Oracle APEX are: You can visualize data as bar, line, area, range, combination, scatter, bubble, polar, radar, pie, donut, funnel and more. This statement is true because Oracle APEX provides a rich set of chart types that can be used to display data in different ways and support different analysis scenarios. You can choose from over 20 chart types when creating a chart in Oracle APEX. Oracle APEX supports charts based on the Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (Oracle JET) Data Visualizations. This statement is true because Oracle APEX uses Oracle JET as the underlying technology for rendering charts in the browser. Oracle JET provides high-performance and interactive data visualizations that are compatible with various devices and browsers. Each Oracle JET visualization supports animation, accessibility, responsive layout, internationalization, test automation, and a range of inter activity features. This statement is true because Oracle JET offers many features and capabilities that enhance the user experience and functionality of the charts. For example: Animation: Charts can have smooth transitions and effects when loading or updating data. Accessibility: Charts can support keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and high contrast mode for users with disabilities. Responsive layout: Charts can adapt to different screen sizes and orientations by resizing or repositioning elements. Internationalization: Charts can support different languages, date formats, number formats, and text directions for users from different regions.

        "explanations": "Explanation: A bar chart is a type of chart that displays data as horizontal or vertical bars with lengths proportional to the values they represent. A bar chart can have one or more data series, which are groups of data points that share the same color and legend item. To enable ?hide and show? behavior of a data series in a bar chart when its corresponding legend item is clicked, you need to set the Hide and Show Behavior attribute value to either Rescale or No Rescaling. The Hide and Show Behavior attribute determines how the chart behaves when a data series is hidden or shown by clicking on its legend item. The possible values are: None: The chart does not support hiding or showing data series by clicking on legend items. Rescale: The chart supports hiding or showing data series by clicking on legend items, and rescales the axes accordingly. No Rescaling: The chart supports hiding or showing data series by clicking on legend items, but does not rescale the axes. Setting the on Data Change attribute value to slide to Left will not affect the ?hide and show? behavior of a data series in a bar chart.

        "explanations": "Explanation: Dynamic actions are a declarative way to define client-side behavior without writing JavaScript code. You can create dynamic actions on an item, button, or region of a page by specifying the event, condition, affected elements, action, and other properties. Some of the statements that are true about creating and using dynamic actions are: You can execute JavaScript code by creating a dynamic action. One of the supported action types is Execute JavaScript Code, which allows you to enter custom JavaScript code to run when the dynamic action fires. If a client-side condition is defined, the true action will fire when the condition is met, and the false action will fire when it is not. You can define a client-side condition for a dynamic action to control when it should fire based on an expression or value. You can also define different actions for the true and false branches of the condition. You can add additional true actions to a dynamic action by clicking the Add True Action button in the Property Editor.

Some of the statements that are true about Oracle APEX are: APEX eliminates middle-tier application logic. APEX runs entirely within Oracle Database and does not require any additional middleware or application server to function. This simplifies the architecture and reduces the complexity, cost, and security risks of deploying applications. You can build interactive reporting apps based on data from disparate systems. APEX supports various data sources, such as local database, REST Enabled SQL Service, REST Data Source, Web Source Module, etc. You can use these data sources to create interactive reports that allow end users to filter, sort, search, aggregate, and visualize data from different sources. The other statements are false because: Application definition is stored in the database. APEX stores the metadata of the application components, such as pages, regions, items, buttons, etc., in the database tables. Processing and data manipulation is executed in the database. APEX leverages the power and performance of Oracle Database to process and manipulate data using SQL and PL/SQL. Running an APEX app does not need client software.

        "explanations": "Explanation: The APEX_MAIL package is an API for the APEX mail system that enables developers to send emails from PL/SQL code. Some of the statements that are true about the APEX_MAIL package are: You can add files as attachments to your emails using the APEX_MAIL package. You can use the APEX_MAIL.ADD_ATTACHMENT procedure to add one or more files as attachments to your emails. The files can be in various formats, such as PDF, DOCX, XLSX, etc. You can send emails using the APEX_MAIL package from an Oracle APEX application. You can use the APEX_MAIL.SEND procedure or function to send an outbound email message from your application. You can also specify various parameters for your email, such as sender, recipients, subject, body, priority, etc. The APEX_MAIL package does not support sending emails only to Oracle database users or receiving emails in an Oracle APEX application. You can send emails to any valid email address or use other tools or services to receive emails.
